## Installation

### 1. Server
Upload "server" folder on your remote server, then open the file Server/chat.php and edit these lines for database connection:

```
$col = 'mysql:host=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;dbname=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';
$username = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
$password = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
```
Then modify the $serverKey variable with a password of your choice (which you will never have to change), this will be used to generate the tokens
```
$serverKey = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';
```
Now you need to indicate what is your users table and what the id and name columns are called. For example, if your table has this structure:
```
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id_user` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `username` varchar(255) NOT NULL
);
```
You will need to modify the $userTable to do this:
```
$userTable = array(
	"name" => "users",
	"columns" => array(
		"id" => "id_user",
		"name" => "username"
	)
);
```
### 2. Client
Open Client/index.html and Client/test.html and change these line for point to remote php file just uploaded

```
server: "http://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/chat.php",
```

### 3. Test
To do a test go to: https://your-site/Client/intex.php?user_id=XXXXXX

instead of the X we need to put the user id that we find in the "users" table (in our example).  

**NOTE:** This is an example only and is not safe! We shouldn't be able to see a user's private chats without a login but simply by guessing its user id.  To make the example safe, you need to edit the line:  

    current_user: "<?php require_once("../Server/chat.php"); echo get_token($_GET['user_id']); ?>"

With something like this:

    current_user: "<?php require_once("../Server/chat.php"); echo get_token(your_login_function()["id"]); ?>"

**NOTE:** At the first start some tables will be created in your database
